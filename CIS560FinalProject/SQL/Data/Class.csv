Cleric,"""Clerics have control of Interplanary powers, which they use to heal and protect themselves and others. They can further support their team by crafting elixirs to aid them in various situations. As interplanary powers are a form of magic, Clerics can also enchant gems and scrolls. A cleric’s role on the battlefield is to heal, revive, or protect their allies. Clerics have the ability to become tanky Paladins or supportive Soothsayers."""
Noble,"""Nobles are negotiators, leaders, and tacticians. Far from the lofty, arrogant, braggart stereotype, these Nobles usually have pockets and minds that are deeper than they let on. In-game, Nobles have a small town to manage that gives them a variety of resources to utilize. While useful in a battle, much of a Noble’s power comes from their connections with powerful people. During combat, they control the flow of battle, supporting their allies with their tactical awareness. This is accomplished either on the front lines as a Knight or by directing the fight as a Lord."""
Ranger,"""Rangers excel at everything from guarding nobles to stopping hostile warbands in their tracks. These versatile survivors tend to specialize in the field of archery, and all Rangers use a bow or some other type of ranged weapon. Skilled in hunting, tracking, and securing objectives, these adventurers either become master trackers—Stalkers—or war Bowmen."""
Rogue,"""A surprisingly wide variety of people train in this mysterious, stealthy discipline. The less honorable among them have the ability to master the darker side of combat, employing poisons and stealthy armor-piercing stabs. Some Rogues with a different sense of nobility and honor may find the arts of obtaining things without murder more to their tastes; with inexplicably deft movements, they can quietly take things from their enemies, or devise silver-tongued trickeries that can be useful in a variety of situations. Experienced Rogues become Assassins or Thieves."""
Spellbinder,"""Spellbinders are fighters that use power from the void. They mainly use this power to counter magic; they specialize in fighting Wizards by nullifying or reflecting their spells, teleporting to the source of magic, etc. Spellbinders can enchant void-related gems or scrolls and are able to sense the realm of the arcane in some capacity. Spellbinders can become Sentinels, fighters who use the void as a more direct source of protection and battlefield disruption, or Harbingers, who focus on using their void powers to dispose of enemies as quickly as possible. """
Warrior,"""Warriors typically train to high proficiency in their weapon(s) of choice and specialize in plain weapons fighting. This allows them to deal and withstand relatively high damage, even more so depending on their specialization. By utilizing physical combat skills, they can end a fight quickly with a decent weapon. Warriors start with a Warrior Title that augments their fighting style; they can earn more titles over time. They will eventually specialize into either Berserkers who thrive when fighting large groups of enemies or Champions who prefer dueling one on one."""
