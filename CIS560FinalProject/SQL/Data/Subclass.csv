BaseCleric,"""Clerics have control of Interplanary powers, which they use to heal and protect themselves and others. They can further support their team by crafting elixirs to aid them in various situations. As interplanary powers are a form of magic, Clerics can also enchant gems and scrolls. A cleric’s role on the battlefield is to heal, revive, or protect their allies. Clerics have the ability to become tanky Paladins or supportive Soothsayers.""",Cleric

BaseNoble,"""Nobles are negotiators, leaders, and tacticians. Far from the lofty, arrogant, braggart stereotype, these Nobles usually have pockets and minds that are deeper than they let on. In-game, Nobles have a small town to manage that gives them a variety of resources to utilize. While useful in a battle, much of a Noble’s power comes from their connections with powerful people. During combat, they control the flow of battle, supporting their allies with their tactical awareness. This is accomplished either on the front lines as a Knight or by directing the fight as a Lord.

BaseRanger,"""Rangers excel at everything from guarding nobles to stopping hostile warbands in their tracks. These versatile survivors tend to specialize in the field of archery, and all Rangers use a bow or some other type of ranged weapon. Skilled in hunting, tracking, and securing objectives, these adventurers either become master trackers—Stalkers—or war Bowmen.""",Ranger

BaseRogue,"""A surprisingly wide variety of people train in this mysterious, stealthy discipline. The less honorable among them have the ability to master the darker side of combat, employing poisons and stealthy armor-piercing stabs. Some Rogues with a different sense of nobility and honor may find the arts of obtaining things without murder more to their tastes; with inexplicably deft movements, they can quietly take things from their enemies, or devise silver-tongued trickeries that can be useful in a variety of situations. Experienced Rogues become Assassins or Thieves.""",Rogue
